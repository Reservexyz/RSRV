## **1. Overview**
Reserve.xyz enables deposits into Hyperliquid’s HLP vault while maintaining **the exact same security and risk profile** as depositing directly — but with automated APR redirection into other assets or strategies.

- Principal stays in HLP  
- Only APR is reallocated  
- No additional principal risk

We don't change exposure — we automate yield flow to help users accumulate what they want to own.

### Benefits
- Automated compounding into chosen assets

- No added risk vs HLP

## **3. Core Design**

### **3.1 Mandatory 100% HLP Principal**
At launch:
- 100% of principal goes to HLP  
- Guaranteed same risk level as HLP  

Later phases may support flexible allocations.

### **3.2 APR Redirection**
Only yield generated by HLP is redirected to a target asset chosen by the user.

Assets may include:
- BTC, ETH, HYPE, SOL…
- Curated baskets (BTC/ETH/SOL/HYPE)
- New launchpad tokens
- Future optional categories (NFTs, collectibles)

---

### **3.3 Compounding Frequency**
User selects compounding period:
- Daily  
- Weekly  
- Monthly  
- Custom (T)

---

### **3.4 Immutable Vaults (I)**
Vaults can be deployed with unchangeable parameters.

Displayed with an **(I)** tag.

Example:  
**BTC-Accumulator (I)** — 100% HLP, APR → BTC, weekly compounding

### **3.5 Permissionless Vault Creation**
Anyone can create a vault.

This enables:
- Personal strategies  
- DAO vaults  
- Theme & meme vaults  
- Community vaults
