# **Reserve: HLP-Native Vaults for Collective Coordination**

### _Redirecting HLP yield into programmable, composable value flows._

---

## **1. Vision**

Reserve is built on a simple but powerful premise: **yield shouldn’t just compound — it should coordinate.**    

It transforms HLP yield into an **on-chain coordination mechanism** capable of funding collective actions.

---

## **2. Concept**

**Reserve Vaults** are **immutable, HLP-native vaults** that capture the yield generated by the HLP and **programmatically redirect it** according to predefined or governed strategies.  

- The **principal** always remains fully exposed to the HLP.  
- Only the **yield flow** is redistributed.  
- This yield can be **reinvested, accumulated, converted, or redirected** toward initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem.  

> The exposure remains 100% HLP.  
> What changes is the **path of the yield**.

---

## **3. Core Mechanics**

- **Vault Entry:** Users deposit into a **Reserve vault**, not directly into the HLP.  
- **100% HLP Exposure:** Each vault maintains **full exposure to the Hyperliquid Liquidity Pool (HLP)**.  
- **Yield Accrual:** The vault continuously **collects the APR flow** generated from its HLP exposure.  
- **Flow Redirection:** At each interval (block, epoch, or event-based trigger), the **yield stream** is **redirected** according to the vault’s defined policy (e.g., compounding, liquidity bootstrap, ecosystem grants).  
- **Immutability & Governance:** Core vault logic remains immutable; allocation parameters and weights are governed within defined boundaries.  
- **Principal Integrity:** The **principal never leaves the HLP** — only the **yield flow** is programmatically redirected or reallocated.  
- **Temporal Logic:** Vaults can operate on different time models — continuous (per-block), epoch-based (e.g., weekly), or trigger-based (based on thresholds or performance events).

## **4. Strategy Directions**

Vault strategies can operate **natively within the Hyperliquid ecosystem** or extend **exogenously beyond it**, depending on the vault’s purpose and governance policy.  
Both models share the same foundation: the vault remains **100% HLP-exposed**, while only the **yield flow** is programmatically redirected.  

These routes may use different technical paths — some purely internal to Hyperliquid, others leveraging **external connectors or bridges** when permitted by the system’s architecture and risk policy.  
This design allows the Reserve layer to coordinate actions both *within* and *beyond* Hyperliquid, while preserving transparency and safety at all times.

Below are the main strategic directions:

- **Compounding (optional):** Reinvest part or all of the yield back into HLP to grow base exposure when desired.  
- **Asset Accumulation:** Redirect yield to accumulate a specific token (e.g., HYPE), NFT, or curated basket of assets.  
- **Bootstrap Liquidity:** Deploy yield to create or incentivize new liquidity pools, either on Hyperliquid or across partner ecosystems.  
- **Protocol Reinforcement:** Allocate yield toward buy-backs, token locks, safety modules, or core protocol development.  
- **Collective Funding:** Channel yield into grants, retroactive funding, or community-driven initiatives.  
- **Exogenous Asset Exposure:** Accumulate LSTs, governance tokens, or NFTs not listed on Hyperliquid Core, expanding exposure to non-native assets.  
- **External Yield Systems:** Route yield into low-risk external systems (e.g., restaking, money markets, or other on-chain income sources) to diversify inflows.  
- **Strategic Expansion:** Direct yield to bootstrap liquidity on partner chains, fund integrations, or acquire productive infrastructure positions.  

> Each vault defines its own yield path — remaining HLP-native by design, yet capable of extending outward when strategically useful through governed, transparent, and modular routing mechanisms.

## **5. Recursive & Composable Models**

- **Cross-Vault Recursion:** Yield from one vault can feed another (e.g., Vault A compounds, Vault B bootstraps).  
- **Meta-Vault:** A higher-level vault aggregates multiple underlying vaults with governance-defined weights.  
- **Trigger-Based Allocation:** Dynamic thresholds (TVL, yield, health metrics) adjust allocation ratios in real time.  

> From simple vaults to a **network of interconnected flows** reinforcing each other across the ecosystem.

## **6. Example of Vault Archetypes**

Below are practical examples of how HLP yield can be redirected through Reserve vaults.  
Each one represents a different use case — all maintaining 100% exposure to the HLP principal.

| **Example** | **HLP Exposure** | **Yield Flow Distribution** | **Description** |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| **HYPE Accumulation Vault** | 100% HLP | 70% compounding / 30% HYPE accumulation | Uses HLP yield to automatically buy and accumulate HYPE, creating long-term alignment with protocol value. |
| **Basket Accumulation Vault** | 100% HLP | 60% compounding / 40% basket accumulation *(e.g., HYPE + stables + governance tokens)* | Builds a balanced treasury that diversifies yield across multiple strategic assets. |
| **Liquidity Bootstrap Vault** | 100% HLP | 50% compounding / 50% directed to new HL pool seeding | Uses yield to bootstrap liquidity for newly launched assets or trading pairs on Hyperliquid. |
| **Exogenous Accumulation Vault** | 100% HLP | 50% compounding / 50% accumulation of exogenous assets *(e.g., LSTs, NFTs, unlisted tokens)* | Accumulates non-native assets to hedge volatility and build cross-ecosystem exposure. |
| **External Yield Vault** | 100% HLP | 60% compounding / 40% routed to low-risk external yield *(e.g., money markets, restaking services)* | Allocates part of HLP yield to exogenous yield systems while maintaining on-chain safety. |
| **Time-Redirected Compounding Vault** | 100% HLP | 100% yield compounding, redirected every fixed period toward another asset | Compounds HLP yield continuously, but periodically converts and compounds it into a target asset (e.g., daily auto-buy of HYPE, governance tokens, or curated basket). |
| **Meta-Vault (Compositional)** | 100% HLP | Dynamic — allocates yield across 3–5 other vaults | A “vault of vaults” that automatically balances yield flow among ecosystem, resilience, and external strategies. |

> These archetypes illustrate how a single HLP yield stream can be turned into programmable capital — compounding locally, accumulating strategically, or coordinating across systems.

## **7. Why It Matters**

Reserve is more than a yield aggregator — it’s a **coordination layer** for the Hyperliquid economy.  
By keeping principal exposure entirely HLP-native and reprogramming yield flows, Reserve vaults turn passive yield into **productive, directional capital**: funding growth, safety, innovation, and shared infrastructure.  

> **Yield doesn’t just compound — it coordinates.**
