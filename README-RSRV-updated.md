# **Reserve: HLP-Native Yield Routing Primitive**

### _Turning HLP yield into programmable, composable value flows._

---

## **1. Vision**

Reserve is built on a simple but powerful premise: **yield shouldn’t just accumulate — it should be composable.**  

Rather than acting as a yield strategy or optimizer, Reserve provides a **base-layer primitive** that makes HLP yield **programmable and redirectable** across the ecosystem.  

It’s designed as **open infrastructure** for anyone to deploy vaults that define *how HLP-generated yield is handled* — transparently, permissionlessly, and without altering exposure.

---

## **2. Concept**

**Reserve Vaults** are **HLP-linked, permissionless vaults** that capture the yield produced by HLP and **programmatically redirect it** according to user-defined or governance-defined policies.  

- The **principal** always remains fully exposed to HLP.  
- Only the **yield flow** is captured and redistributed.  
- This yield can be **reinvested, streamed, converted, or redirected** toward any on-chain destination or coordination mechanism.  

> The exposure remains 100% HLP.  
> What changes is the **path and use of the yield**.

On Reserve, **anyone can deploy their own vault** tied to HLP and define what to do with its yield — whether to accumulate, redirect, distribute, or use it to coordinate collective actions.

## **3. Core Mechanics**

- **Vault Creation:** Any user or protocol can create a **Reserve vault** linked to HLP.  
- **Full HLP Exposure:** Each vault maintains **complete exposure to the Hyperliquid Liquidity Pool (HLP)**; Reserve never takes custody or hedges the underlying.  
- **Yield Capture:** Vaults **collect the APR flow** generated by HLP positions.  
- **Yield Redirection:** The captured yield is **redirected** according to the vault’s logic (e.g., compounding, streaming to addresses, funding other systems).  
- **Immutability & Governance:** Core contract logic is immutable; routing parameters and weights can be set or governed within defined boundaries.  
- **Principal Integrity:** The **principal always stays within HLP** — only the yield flow moves.  
- **Time Logic:** Vaults can operate continuously (per block), epoch-based (weekly), or on triggers (performance or threshold-based).

## **4. Yield Routing Strategies**

Vaults built on Reserve define **how and where HLP yield is routed**, while the principal remains 100% HLP-exposed.  

Routes can operate **natively within Hyperliquid** or **extend externally** via bridges, connectors, or partner protocols — enabling Reserve to function as **yield plumbing** for the broader ecosystem.

### **Routing Modes**

1. **Asset Accumulation**  
   Use yield to accumulate specific assets — native or external.  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Accumulate HYPE to strengthen protocol alignment.  
     - Build baskets of stablecoins or ecosystem tokens.  
     - Acquire external productive or governance assets.

2. **Liquidity and Expansion**  
   Redirect yield to bootstrap liquidity or markets.  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Seed liquidity for new pairs.  
     - Support cross-ecosystem liquidity bridges.

3. **Ecosystem and Collective Funding**  
   Route yield toward shared or public goods.  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Fund community initiatives, grants, or R&D.  
     - Support safety modules, resilience funds, or insurance.

4. **External Yield and Integration**  
   Allocate part of the yield to external yield systems (within limits).  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Restaking services, low-risk money markets, integrations with other protocols.  
     - Diversified treasury strategies.

> Each vault defines its own routing policy — programmable, transparent, and composable — enabling multiple strategies or sequences over time.

## **5. Composable & Recursive Architectures**

Reserve vaults are **modular and composable**.  
They can interconnect to form **recursive systems**, where yield from one vault becomes the input for another, or multiple vaults coordinate under shared logic.

- **Cross-Vault Recursion:** Yield from Vault A can flow into Vault B (e.g., auto-compound → fund).  
- **Meta-Vaults:** Aggregator vaults combine multiple sub-vaults with weighted routing.  
- **Trigger-Based Allocation:** Dynamic conditions (TVL, yield rate, volatility) adjust routing in real time.  

> From single vaults to **networks of interlinked yield flows**, Reserve enables a programmable architecture for capital coordination.

## **6. Why It Matters**

Reserve is not a yield strategy — it’s **yield infrastructure**.  
By keeping exposure fully HLP-native and reprogramming only the yield flow, Reserve transforms passive yield into **programmable capital** that can fund growth, safety, and coordination across the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

> **Yield doesn’t just compound — it connects.**
