# **Reserve: HLP-Native Vaults for Collective Coordination**

### _Redirecting HLP yield into programmable, composable value flows._

---

## **1. Vision**

Reserve is built on a simple but powerful premise: **yield shouldn’t just compound — it should coordinate.**  

It transforms HLP yield into an **on-chain coordination mechanism** capable of funding collective actions.

---

## **2. Concept**

**Reserve Vaults** are **immutable, HLP-native vaults** that capture the yield generated by the HLP and **programmatically redirect it** according to predefined or governance-defined strategies.  

- The **principal** always remains fully exposed to the HLP.  
- Only the **yield flow** is redistributed.  
- This yield can be **reinvested, accumulated, converted, or redirected** toward initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem.  

> The exposure remains 100% HLP.  
> What changes is the **path of the yield**.

## **3. Core Mechanics**

- **Vault Entry:** Users deposit into a **Reserve vault**, not directly into the HLP.  
- **100% HLP Exposure:** Each vault maintains **full exposure to the Hyperliquid Liquidity Pool (HLP)**.  
- **Yield Accrual:** The vault continuously **collects the APR flow** generated from its HLP exposure.  
- **Flow Redirection:** At each interval (block, epoch, or event-based trigger), the **yield stream** is **redirected** according to the vault’s defined policy (e.g., compounding, liquidity bootstrap, ecosystem grants).  
- **Immutability & Governance:** Core vault logic remains immutable; allocation parameters and weights are governed by predefined parameters and limits.  
- **Principal Integrity:** The **principal never leaves the HLP** — only the **yield flow** is programmatically redirected or reallocated.  
- **Temporal Logic:** Vaults can operate on different time models — continuous (per-block), epoch-based (e.g., weekly), or trigger-based (based on thresholds or performance events).

## **4. Yield Routing Strategies**

Vaults built on Reserve can direct their yield flows through a variety of programmable routes.  
These strategies determine **how and where HLP-generated yield is redirected**, while the vault’s principal always remains 100% HLP-exposed.  

Routes can operate **natively within Hyperliquid** or extend **exogenously** through bridges, connectors, or partner protocols — depending on vault purpose, governance, and system permissions.  
This flexibility allows Reserve vaults to function as a coordination layer between **yield generation, accumulation, and ecosystem growth**.

### **Routing Modes** 

1. **Asset Accumulation**  
   Yield is used to accumulate specific assets — native or external.  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Accumulate HYPE to strengthen alignment with protocol value.  
     - Build a basket of ecosystem tokens, stables, or NFTs.  
     - Accumulate non-Hyperliquid assets such as LSTs, governance tokens, or unlisted tokens.  

2. **Liquidity and Expansion**  
   Yield flows are redirected to bootstrap new markets or liquidity pools.  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Seed liquidity for a new pool or asset.  
     - Bootstrap liquidity in partner ecosystems via external bridges.  

3. **Ecosystem and Collective Funding**  
   Yield is allocated to shared initiatives or community infrastructure.  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Fund retroactive grants or on-chain public goods.  
     - Support development, research, or resilience modules.  

4. **External Yield and Diversification**  
   Part of the yield can be routed into other yield-bearing systems (within defined limits).  
   - *Examples:*  
     - Deploy in restaking services, low-risk money markets, or cross-ecosystem integrations.  
     - Acquire productive external assets or infrastructure positions.  

> Each vault defines its own yield routing policy — programmable, transparent, and fully governed — capable of combining or sequencing multiple strategies over time.

## **5. Composable & Recursive Architectures**

Reserve vaults are inherently composable.  
They can interconnect to form **recursive systems**, where one vault’s output becomes another’s input, or where multiple vaults operate in synergy.

- **Cross-Vault Recursion:** Yield from one vault can feed another (e.g., Vault A compounds, Vault B bootstraps).  
- **Meta-Vault Structures:** Higher-level vaults aggregate multiple underlying vaults with adjustable weights.  
- **Trigger-Based Allocation:** Dynamic thresholds (e.g., TVL, yield rate, volatility) modify routing logic in real time.  

> From individual vaults to a **network of interlinked flows**, Reserve enables a self-reinforcing architecture of programmable capital.

## **6. Why It Matters**

Reserve is more than a yield aggregator — it’s a **coordination layer** for the Hyperliquid economy.  
By keeping principal exposure entirely HLP-native and reprogramming yield flows, Reserve vaults turn passive yield into **productive, directional capital**: funding growth, safety, innovation, and shared infrastructure.  

> **Yield doesn’t just compound — it coordinates.**
